## Output data to HTML:
* String interpolation: {{data}}
* Property binding: [property]="data" ex: [disabled]="shouldDisable"
## React to user events: 
* Event binding: (event)="expression"

> Two-way binding is the combination of both


> In string interpolation you can either use an itinerary expression or a method call or string directly.

> The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for `YOUR_ELEMENT` properties or events should yield nice results.

> FormsModule is required for two way binding.
